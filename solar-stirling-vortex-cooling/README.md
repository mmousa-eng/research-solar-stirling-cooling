# Solar Stirling Vortex Cooling Project

This project simulates a solar Stirling engine system integrated with a vortex tube for cooling applications. The simulation aims to analyze the performance of the system under various conditions and visualize the results through plots.

## Project Structure

- **constants.py**: Defines all constant parameters used in the simulation, including physical constants and system specifications.
- **vortex_correlation.py**: Implements the vortex tube correlation model using a small embedded dataset. It includes functions to calculate correlation values based on the dataset.
- **solar_stirling_system.py**: Combines the solar collector, Stirling engine, compressor, and vortex tube into a unified simulation algorithm. It includes methods to calculate power output, compressor load, cooling capacity, and other relevant metrics.
- **performance_plots.py**: Generates performance graphs for the system, such as solar irradiance versus power output and pressure ratio versus cooling effect. It utilizes a plotting library to visualize the results.
- **main.py**: The main script that runs the simulation using the modules defined above. It orchestrates the simulation process and saves results and plots into the 'results/' folder.
- **results/**: Directory intended to store the output results and plots generated by the simulation.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/solar-stirling-vortex-cooling.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd solar-stirling-vortex-cooling
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Overview of the Simulation

The simulation integrates various components of a solar Stirling system, including:
- A solar collector that captures solar energy.
- A Stirling engine that converts thermal energy into mechanical work.
- A compressor that manages the working fluid.
- A vortex tube that provides cooling through the separation of hot and cold air.

The performance of the system is analyzed through various metrics, and results are visualized for better understanding and analysis.
