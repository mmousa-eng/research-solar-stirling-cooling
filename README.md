│
├── main.py                   # The main entry point. Runs the simulation, saves results, and generates all performance plots.
├── constants.py              # Contains all physical and simulation constants used throughout the project (temperatures, pressures, Cp, etc.).
├── vortex_correlation.py     # Contains the function(s) to calculate vortex tube performance/correlation.
├── performance_plots.py      # Contains all plotting functions for visualizing simulation results (I vs P, I vs CC, I vs η_tot, etc.).
├── solar_stirling_system.py  # (Assumed from your import) Contains the SolarStirlingSystem class, which models and runs the main system simulation.
